# Happy Customers

The company is one the fastest growing logistics and delivery domain. It works with several partners and make on-demand deliveries to its customers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is facing several different challenges and everyday they are trying to address these challenges. If they can predict what makes their customers happy or unhappy, then they can take the necessary actions. Also, they'd like to know which features are the best for their surveys as it is difficult to get feedback from customers and making them do surveys. 

The conclusion I've reached after exploring and analyzing the data provided by the company: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model produced the best results with an accuracy score of 0.731. Also, from the correlations of the features with our target variable. I came to the conclusion that to make our survey easier and without affecting our analysis and prediction to a minimum, we can disregard two variables which are:

X2 (Contents of my order was as I expected).
X4 (I paid a good price for my order).
